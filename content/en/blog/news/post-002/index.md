## Anouncement

We are happy to announce the creation of a new version of Cloudmesh pi burn 

cms burn is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of building 
clusters with Raspberry Pi's. It allows users to create readily bootable 
SD cards that have the network configured, contain a public ssh key from your 
machine that you used to configure the cards. Thus not much additional setup 
is needed for a cluster. Another unique feature is that you can burn multiple 
cards in a row, each with their individual setup such as hostnames and ipadresses.

A detailed description of Cloudmesh PI burn is available from 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-burn/blob/main/README.md>
